sed, short for "stream editor", allows you to filter and transform text.</h3>

Description
</h2>
<h7>
sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file, or input from a pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

<h3>
If you do not specify INPUTFILE, or if INPUTFILE is "-", sed filters the contents of the standard input. The script is actually the first non-option parameter, which sed specially considers a script and not an input file if and only if none of the other options specifies a script to be executed (that is, if neither of the -e and -f options is specified).
