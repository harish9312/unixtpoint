About awk
</h1>
<h3>
 Short for "Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan," AWK is an interpreted programming language which focuses on processing text.

AWK was developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan. It was designed to execute complex pattern-matching operations on streams of textual data. It makes heavy use of strings, associative arrays, and regular expressions, and is immensely useful for parsing system data and generating automatic reports.

AWK is a direct predecessor of Perl, and is still very useful in modern systems. The GNU free software project distributes an open-source version of AWK called gawk.
