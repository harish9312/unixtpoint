grep, which stands for "global regular expression print," processes text line by line and prints any lines which match a specified pattern.<h2>
Description
</h2>
<h7>
grep is a stream editor. A stream editor is ugrep to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file, or input from a pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), grep works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is grep's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

Grep is a powerful tool for matching a regular expression against text in a file, multiple files, or a stream of input. It searches for the PATTERN of text that you specify on the command line, and outputs the results for you.
